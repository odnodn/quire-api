# Introduction
Welcome to the reference for the Quire REST API!

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST_API" target="_blank">REST</a> is a web-service protocol that lends itself to rapid development by using everyday HTTP and JSON technology.

The Quire REST API provides a broad set of operations and resources that:

  * Consistently doing repetitive or tedious tasks.
  * Chaining a process together by responding to changes.
  * Pulling information from other locations like email or Evernote into Quire.
  * Customizing Asana for your teamâ€™s processes and workflows.

Want to share your opinion on how our API works for you? <a href="https://quire.io/w/Quire_Feedbacks" target="_blank">Tell us how you feel </a>about using our API and what we can do to make it better.

# Authentication
## OAuth v2.0

Quire recommends that you use OAuth v2.0 to authenticate to the Quire REST API. 

Quire recommends you to create a dedicated API user with API write access on a tenant when authenticating via OAuth, and then create an OAuth client for this user. See <a href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users/Create_an_API_User" target="_blank">Create an API User</a> for how to do this. By creating a dedicated API user, you can control permissions of the API user without affecting other non-API users.

If a user is deactivated, all of the user's OAuth clients will be automatically deactivated.

Authenticating via OAuth requires the following steps:
1. Create a Client
2. Generate a Token
3. Make Authenticated Requests

### Create a Client

You must first [create an OAuth client](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users#Create_an_OAuth_Client_for_a_User) in the Zuora UI. To do this, you must be an administrator of your Zuora tenant. This is a one-time operation. You will be provided with a Client ID and a Client Secret. Please note this information down, as it will be required for the next step.

**Note:** The OAuth client will be owned by a Zuora user account. If you want to perform PUT, POST, or DELETE operations using the OAuth client, the owner of the OAuth client must have a Platform role that includes the "\API Write Access" permission.

### Generate a Token

After creating a client, you must make a call to obtain a bearer token using the [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) operation. This operation requires the following parameters:
- `client_id` - the Client ID displayed when you created the OAuth client in the previous step
- `client_secret` - the Client Secret displayed when you created the OAuth client in the previous step
- `grant_type` - must be set to `client_credentials`

**Note**: The Client ID and Client Secret mentioned above were displayed when you created the OAuth Client in the prior step. The [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) response specifies how long the bearer token is valid for. Call [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) again to generate a new bearer token.

### Make Authenticated Requests

To authenticate subsequent API requests, you must provide a valid bearer token in an HTTP header:

`Authorization: Bearer {bearer_token}`

If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Entities) enabled, you need to set an additional header to specify the ID of the entity that you want to access. You can use the `scope` field in the [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) response to determine whether you need to specify an entity ID.

If the `scope` field contains more than one entity ID, you must specify the ID of the entity that you want to access. For example, if the `scope` field contains `entity.1a2b7a37-3e7d-4cb3-b0e2-883de9e766cc` and `entity.c92ed977-510c-4c48-9b51-8d5e848671e9`, specify one of the following headers:
- `Zuora-Entity-Ids: 1a2b7a37-3e7d-4cb3-b0e2-883de9e766cc`
- `Zuora-Entity-Ids: c92ed977-510c-4c48-9b51-8d5e848671e9`

**Note**: For a limited period of time, Zuora will accept the `entityId` header as an alternative to the `Zuora-Entity-Ids` header. If you choose to set the `entityId` header, you must remove all "-" characters from the entity ID in the `scope` field.

If the `scope` field contains a single entity ID, you do not need to specify an entity ID.

# Rate limits

To protect the stability of the API and keep it available to all users, Quire enforces multiple kinds of rate limiting. 
Requests that hit any of our rate limits will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
We may change these quotas or add new quotas (such as maximum requests per hour) in the future.

| Plan    | Maximum requests per minute 
|---------|-----------------------------
| Free    | 150
| Premium | 1500

# Status codes

| Code | Meaning               | Description

| 200  | Success               | Request successful
| 400  | Bad Request           | Request parameter name or value is invalid
| 403  | Forbidden             | Not authorized to access the resource.
| 404  | Not Found             | Requested entity is not found.
| 429  | Too Many Requests     | Exceeded the [rate limit](#section/Rate-limits) for API calls
| 500  | Internal Server Error | Error on the internal server

## Error responses
The following JSON data is returned in the response body when an error occurs.
```json
{
  "message": "Not found"
}
```
